    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ancient recipe from the late 'Parasites from Andromeda' pandemic
         was discovered by a young man dropping some eggs he found into a 
         large pot of boiling water he was using to kill the parasites. 
         It took him six minutes to retrieve the egg with his bare hands, 
         by which time the egg was perfectly cooked. </p>
